# 📈 QA Value & ROI Report (Quarterly)

**Project:** Gmail Security Module  
**QA Lead:** Baskar  
**Reporting Period:** Qx FY20xx

> **Executive Summary:**  
> This report quantifies how Quality Engineering delivered measurable cost savings, improved release confidence, and accelerated delivery velocity—while maintaining industry-leading defect containment.

---

## 💰 Cost & Efficiency Gains

- **Manual Effort Reduction**  
  Automated 40 legacy regression scenarios, saving **~160 QA hours per month**.

- **GenAI Test Design Acceleration**  
  Reduced test case design time from **~2 hours per story to ~15 minutes** using curated LLM prompts.

- **Infrastructure Optimisation**  
  Migrated from always-on VMs to **Dockerised, on-demand execution**, reducing cloud spend by **~20%**.

- **AI-Assisted RCA**  
  Incident triage time reduced from **~3 hours to ~30 minutes** using GenAI-supported root cause analysis.

---

## 🛡️ Quality Safeguards & Release Confidence

- **Defect Leakage**  
  Production defects held at **<1%**, despite a **2× increase in release frequency**.

- **Developer Feedback Velocity**  
  End-to-end feedback loop reduced from **~60 minutes to ~8 minutes** via Playwright parallelisation.

- **Escaped Defect Prevention**  
  Combined Manual + Automation + GenAI insights reduced escaped defects by **~35% YoY**.

> Speed increased *without* trading off quality.

---

## 👥 Team Capability & Maturity

- **Retention**  
  **100% team retention** following adoption of the Team Working Agreement and growth framework.

- **Upskilling**  
  Three manual QAs now contributing **10+ Playwright PRs per month**.

- **GenAI Adoption**  
  - 80% of the team actively using GenAI for test design  
  - 100% validation rate on AI-generated scenarios before execution

> GenAI adoption strengthened confidence—not dependency.

## 🤖 GenAI Contribution to ROI

- **Test Case Generation**  
  Reduced test design effort from days to hours across security features.

- **Intelligent Failure Triage**  
  AI-driven log and signal analysis cut RCA time by **~83%**.

- **Exploratory Risk Discovery**  
  GenAI proposes edge cases; engineers validate and refine.

- **Self-Healing Automation**  
  AI-adaptive selectors reduced flaky-test maintenance overhead by **~40%**.

## 📌 Bottom Line

GenAI did not replace QA—it **amplified it**.

By combining:
- Skilled engineers  
- Strong automation foundations  
- Governed GenAI augmentation  

Quality Engineering delivered **lower cost**, **higher confidence**, and **faster delivery**—positioning QA as a measurable value driver, not a cost centre.
