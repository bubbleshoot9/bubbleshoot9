# 🎯 Annual Performance & Goal Setting Framework

> **Strategy:** Align individual growth and career ambition with the **Quality Manifesto** and measurable business ROI—so performance management drives outcomes, not admin.

## 🏗️ 1. The QE Goal Pillars

Every annual objective for QA Engineers and SDETs is balanced across four core pillars. No single pillar can compensate for another.

| Pillar | Objective | Example Key Result (KR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Excellence** | Framework Contribution | Implement 3 custom Playwright fixtures to reduce duplication by 20% |
| **Operational Impact** | Efficiency & Velocity | Reduce the Mobile suite Toil Ratio by 15% via data seeding and API setup |
| **Leadership & Culture** | Mentorship & Enablement | Lead 4 Brown Bag sessions and onboard 2 new starters using self-serve documentation |
| **Business Alignment** | Risk & Value Protection | Achieve zero critical defect leakage in the Payments module across 4 sprints |

> Strong performance is *multi-dimensional*—technical output without business impact is incomplete.

## 🗓️ 2. The Appraisal Lifecycle

Performance is managed as a **continuous feedback loop**, not an annual event.

- **Q1 — Set:**  
  Define 3–5 SMART goals using the Skills Matrix to identify stretch and growth areas

- **Q2 — Pivot:**  
  Mid-year calibration to realign goals with delivery changes (e.g. Selenium → Playwright migration)

- **Q3 — Push:**  
  Emphasis on leadership, influence, and knowledge sharing through talks, mentoring, or architectural documentation

- **Q4 — Assess:**  
  Final appraisal grounded in evidence captured via People, Delivery, and Quality metrics

> Goals evolve as delivery evolves—stability comes from clarity, not rigidity.

## 🧪 3. Sample Goal Template (Senior SDET)

**Goal:** Improve Automation Reliability  

- **Objective:** Stabilise the flaky Checkout regression suite  
- **Action:**  
  - Identify the top 5 unstable tests  
  - Refactor using web-first assertions  
  - Enforce a zero-retry execution policy  
- **Measurement:**  
  Suite pass rate improves from 85% → 98% by end of Q2

## ⚖️ 4. Handling Underperformance (Support-Led PIP)

When targets are consistently missed, we initiate a **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** that is corrective—not punitive.

1. **Diagnose the Root Cause**  
   - Skill gap  
   - Tooling or process friction  
   - Motivation or role misalignment  

2. **Weekly Micro-Goals**  
   Short, achievable objectives with rapid feedback loops

3. **Paired Enablement**  
   Structured pairing with a high performer to accelerate learning and rebuild confidence

> The goal of a PIP is recovery and clarity—exits are a last resort, not a default.
