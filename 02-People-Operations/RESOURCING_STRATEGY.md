# 👥 Resourcing & Talent Strategy

> **Owner:** QA Lead / Manager  
> **Objective:** Build a high-performance, cost-efficient Quality Engineering function using a **Flexible Core** resourcing model.

## 🏗️ 1. The “Flexible Core” Headcount Model

We structure teams to preserve long-term capability while retaining the agility to scale for delivery peaks.

- **Internal Core (30–40%)**  
  Strategic Leads and Architects responsible for:
  - Owning the QA Manifesto and quality principles  
  - Framework architecture and long-term technical direction  
  - Coaching, governance, and standards enforcement  

- **Embedded SDETs (40–50%)**  
  Permanent staff or long-term contractors:
  - Fully integrated into Scrum teams  
  - Accountable for day-to-day delivery quality  
  - Acting as the bridge between Dev, QA, and Product  

- **On-Demand Scaling (10–20%)**  
  Specialist or short-term capacity for:
  - Performance and load testing  
  - Security testing and audits  
  - Peak delivery periods or regulatory deadlines  

> This model maximises institutional knowledge without sacrificing delivery flexibility.

## 🔍 2. Recruitment & Technical Interviewing

Hiring follows a **Hands-on & Mind-on** philosophy—focusing on how candidates think, build, and collaborate.

1. **The Mind (Process & Thinking)**  
   - Can the candidate explain risk-based testing concepts?  
   - Do they understand shift-left quality and testability?  

2. **The Hands (Engineering Ability)**  
   - Live pair-programming session (no take-home tests)  
   - Focus on clean code, readability, and maintainability  
   - Practical problem-solving over algorithmic puzzles  

3. **The Heart (Cultural Fit)**  
   - Alignment with team values and working agreements  
   - Evidence of ownership, curiosity, and collaboration  

> We hire engineers who can grow the system—not just operate it.

## 🤝 3. Vendor & Outsourcing Management (SI / Managed Services)

External partners are governed through **outcome-based accountability**, not headcount metrics.

### Partner KPIs

| Metric | Target | QA Lead Oversight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Automation Contribution** | > 70% of new features | Enforce internal automation standards |
| **Defect Rejection Rate** | < 5% | Ensure actionable, developer-ready defect reports |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Quarterly | Mandatory documentation updates and walkthroughs |

> Vendors extend capability—not ownership. Quality remains an internal responsibility.

## 📈 4. Onboarding & Time-to-Value

The goal is to compress ramp-up time from **weeks to days**.

- **Starter Kit**  
  - Pre-configured local and Docker-based environments  
  - Access to all supported automation frameworks  

- **Buddy System**  
  - Pair each new hire with a “Culture Guardian” for the first two weeks  
  - Focus on ways of working, not just tooling  

- **30 / 60 / 90 Day Plan**  
  - Clear expectations and measurable outcomes  
  - Early delivery of a meaningful, production-quality contribution  

> Onboarding is treated as a product—continuously improved and actively measured.

## 📜 5. IR35 & Contractor Management (UK / EU)

- Proven experience managing **Inside and Outside IR35** engagements  
- Clear Statements of Work (SoWs) with outcome-based deliverables  
- Alignment between legal compliance, delivery flexibility, and contractor quality  

> Compliance is designed in—not retrofitted.

This resourcing strategy ensures the QA function scales intelligently, protects quality standards, and remains commercially credible at every stage of growth.
