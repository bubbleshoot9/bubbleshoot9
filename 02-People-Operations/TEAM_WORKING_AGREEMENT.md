# 🤝 Team Working Agreement (TWA)

> **Our Mission:** Build a high-trust, high-performance QA team that delivers at speed *without* sacrificing quality—anchored in radical candour, empowered ownership, and objective growth.

This agreement defines the behaviours, expectations, and working standards we hold ourselves to. It is a **living document**, reviewed and refined quarterly by the team.

---

## 💎 Core Values — The Foundation of Our Culture

Our culture rests on three non-negotiable pillars that allow quality to scale sustainably.

### 🗣️ Radical Candour
- **Challenge Directly, Care Personally:** Feedback is clear, timely, and constructive. Issues are raised early, discussed openly, and resolved without blame.
- **No “Green-Shifting”:** An early *Red* is always better than a late surprise. Transparency is the default—status reflects reality, not optimism.

---

### 🧠 Empowerment & Autonomy
- **Define the *What*, Not the *How*:** Leadership sets business outcomes and risk context. Engineers own the technical solution.
- **Stop-the-Line Authority:** Any QA Engineer may veto a release if a critical Quality Gate is breached. Quality is a shared responsibility, not a hierarchy.

---

### 📈 Objective Growth
- **Competency-Based Trust:** Responsibility and autonomy grow with demonstrated capability, guided by the Skills Matrix.
- **Deliberate Improvement:** Continuous learning is expected and supported through mentoring, feedback, and clear development plans.

---

## 🛠️ Operational Standards — How We Execute

### 🤝 The “Three Amigos” Protocol
- No ticket moves to **In Progress** until Developer, QA, and Product have aligned on acceptance criteria using the Three Amigos checklist.
- Alignment happens *before* code is written—not during defect triage.

---

### 🤖 Automation-First Mindset
- **Shift-Left by Design:** Automation skeletons (Page Objects, API contracts, mocks) are created in parallel with development.
- **The 10-Minute Rule:** If core regression exceeds 10 minutes, refactoring becomes a priority to protect fast feedback loops.

---

### 🧪 High-Value Manual Testing
- **Discovery Over Repetition:** Manual effort is reserved for exploratory, usability, and security testing—not regression.
- **Chartered Sessions:** All manual testing is time-boxed (60–90 minutes) with a clear charter defining intent and scope.

## 🔄 Communication & Feedback Loops

| Event | Working Agreement | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Stand-up** | Lead with risks, blockers, and Reds—not status theatre | Early Risk Visibility |
| **Pull Requests** | QA reviews dev tests; devs review QA automation | Shared Ownership & Skill Transfer |
| **Post-Mortems** | Blameless RCA focused on process and system improvement | Continuous Learning |

---

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution

When consensus cannot be reached on a **Release / No-Release** decision:

1. **Follow the Data:** Assess impact using the Risk-Based Testing Priority Matrix  
2. **Check the Gates:** Verify whether any Quality Gates have failed  
3. **Lead Veto:** If risk is **Critical (15–25)** and a gate is breached, the QA Lead exercises final veto authority to protect users

> Disagreement is healthy. Silent risk is not.
