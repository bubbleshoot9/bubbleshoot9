# 👥 People & Enablement Metrics

> **Strategic Goal:** Measure, protect, and scale the *human engine* of Quality Engineering—driving high retention, fast ramp-up, and zero knowledge silos.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Scaling & Onboarding Efficiency

*Goal: Eliminate drag between hiring and meaningful delivery.*

| KPI | Target | What We Measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time-to-First-PR** | < 3 days | Days from start date to first merged code, test, or defect fix |
| **Onboarding Velocity** | < 10 days | Time until a new joiner is *sprint-independent* (≤1 hour/day senior support) |
| **Documentation Effectiveness** | > 80% | % of onboarding completed via the Starter Kit without manual intervention |

> Fast onboarding is a force multiplier—every day saved compounds across delivery.

## 📈 2. Skill Growth & Capability Expansion

*Goal: Actively track the evolution from “Manual Tester” to “Quality Engineer.”*

| KPI | Target | What We Measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upskilling Velocity** | Quarterly | Observable movement across the Skills Matrix (e.g. QA → QE → SDET) |
| **Cross-Stack Coverage** | > 60% of team | % of engineers able to contribute across at least two layers (e.g. UI + API) |
| **CPD Completion Rate** | 100% | Every team member completes one meaningful development goal per quarter |

> Skills are treated as assets—measured, grown, and deliberately diversified.

## 🔋 3. Team Health & Sustainable Pace

*Goal: Maintain delivery speed without burnout while protecting the 5:1 Dev-to-QA ratio.*

| KPI | Target | What We Measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Toil Ratio** | < 20% | Time spent on manual regression/admin vs. engineering and improvement work |
| **Silo Heatmap** | 0 critical | Number of framework or domain areas with single-person ownership (bus factor) |
| **Sprint Sentiment** | > 4 / 5 | Retro-based score covering workload balance and tooling effectiveness |

> Sustainable pace is a leading indicator—not a nice-to-have.

## 🤝 4. Vendor & Contractor Effectiveness

*Goal: Ensure external capacity delivers the same quality bar as internal teams.*

| KPI | Target | What We Measure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PR Acceptance Rate** | > 90% | % of partner pull requests passing review standards on first submission |
| **Knowledge Retention** | 100% | Exit documentation captured for every contractor rolling off |
| **Value-per-Head** | Positive | Cost vs. measurable manual effort saved using the Automation ROI model |

> Contractors extend capability—not risk. These metrics keep that balance honest.

## 🛠️ The Lead’s People Dashboard Philosophy

> *“I don’t manage headcount—I manage **capability capacity**.  
> By tracking metrics like Time-to-First-PR and Onboarding Velocity, I can demonstrate to the business that our onboarding and enablement model scales faster, with materially less friction, than traditional QA structures.”*

This dashboard enables proactive decisions on hiring, training, and investment—grounded in evidence, not intuition.
