# 🌱 Growth, Enablement & Continuous Learning

> **Philosophy:** A stagnant team is a delivery risk. We intentionally operate as a *Learning Organization* where knowledge flows horizontally across roles, disciplines, and geographies.

## 🎓 1. “Lead-the-Lab” Brown Bag Sessions

**Ritual:** A rotating monthly technical showcase owned by the team.

- **The Rule:** Every team member (including offshore and partner teams) leads **one session per quarter**
- **Scope:** Not limited to QA. Sessions may include:
  - Intro to Rust
  - Kubernetes for Testers
  - GenAI Prompt Engineering
- **Outcome:**
  - Builds confidence in technical communication
  - Encourages cross-discipline understanding
  - Ensures the **Silo Heatmap** remains healthy and transparent

## 🛠️ 2. QA → QE Career Pathing

We use the **Skills Matrix** to define clear, non-linear growth paths that reward impact over job titles.

| Stage | Focus Area | Milestone Opportunity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explorer** | Tool Proficiency | Automating a critical business flow end-to-end |
| **Builder** | Framework Architecture | Contributing a reusable fixture or utility to the Playwright Hub |
| **Influencer** | Strategic Governance | Leading a Three Amigos session or refining the Quality ROI model |

> Progression is skills-led, opt-in, and reversible—engineers may grow depth or breadth without penalty.

## 🔄 3. Mob-Testing & Peer Reviews

**Ritual:** Weekly 1-hour collaborative session focused on *hard problems*.

- **Format:** Mob-testing / mob-programming on:
  - Flaky tests
  - Complex selectors
  - Framework or architectural bottlenecks
- **Principle:** Problems are owned by the *team*, not individuals
- **Outcome:** Faster unblocking, shared context, and accelerated skill transfer

---

## 📚 4. The External Voice (Community & Brand)

We actively encourage engineers to represent both themselves *and* the organisation externally.

- **Blogging:** One technical post per engineer per half-year
- **Open Source:** Encouraged contributions back to tools we rely on (e.g. Playwright, Appium)
- **Conferences:** Budget allocated for speaker coaching and preparation when talks are accepted (EuroSTAR, TestBash, etc.)

> Thought leadership is treated as a delivery accelerator—not a distraction.

## 🎯 5. Quarterly Development Check-ins

*Replacing annual reviews with continuous, outcome-focused growth.*

Each quarter, every engineer reflects on:

1. **Reflect:** What was the hardest technical challenge you solved this quarter?
2. **Stretch:** Which skill do you want to move from *Basic → Expert* next?
3. **Block:** What process, tool, or dependency is slowing you down the most?

> These are coaching conversations—not performance grading exercises.
