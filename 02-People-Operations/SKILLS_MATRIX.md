# 📊 QA Team Skills Matrix & Development Framework

> **Purpose:** Provide a transparent, objective roadmap for every engineer’s growth across manual, automated, and emerging AI-assisted testing—reinforcing continuous improvement over subjective assessment.

This framework is a **development tool, not a performance scorecard**. It replaces vague feedback with a shared language for growth, enabling fair, constructive, and evidence-based career conversations.

---

## 🎯 How This Framework Is Used

1. **Self-Assessment**  
   Engineers assess themselves honestly against defined competencies and levels.

2. **Lead Review**  
   The QA Lead or Manager reviews the assessment, adding delivery evidence and contextual insight.

3. **Development Conversation**  
   Gaps are discussed collaboratively, resulting in a focused development plan with clear goals and timelines.

4. **Quarterly Check-ins**  
   Progress is reviewed every quarter to recognise growth, recalibrate goals, and remove blockers.

> The matrix is a compass for direction—not a stick for punishment.

## 🏯 Skill Levels

| Level | Definition | Typical Progression |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Level 1 — Learner** | Works under supervision; follows clear instructions and checklists. | Graduate → Level 1 |
| **Level 2 — Practitioner** | Delivers independently on standard work with minimal oversight. | Level 1 → Level 2 (6–12 months) |
| **Level 3 — Specialist** | Solves complex problems, handles edge cases, and mentors others. | Level 2 → Level 3 (12–24 months) |
| **Level 4 — Lead / Architect** | Sets direction, defines standards, and actively grows team capability. | Level 3 → Level 4 (2–3 years) |

## 🛠️ Core Competency Areas

### 🧠 Manual & Exploratory Testing
- **Exploratory Testing:** Designs and executes context-driven, unscripted tests to surface unknown risks  
- **Security & Edge Cases:** Applies risk-based thinking to authentication, data handling, and abuse scenarios  
- **UX & Usability:** Evaluates user journeys, error handling, and recovery paths  
- **Defect Communication:** Produces concise, reproducible, developer-ready defect reports  

---

### 🤖 Test Automation
- **Framework Proficiency:** Effective use of Playwright, Appium, Selenium, or equivalent tools  
- **Programming & Patterns:** Applies clean code principles, Page Object Model, BDD, and data-driven testing  
- **CI/CD Integration:** Embeds automation into pipelines with meaningful reporting and fast feedback  
- **Debugging & Stability:** Diagnoses flaky tests and resolves failures at root cause  

---

### 🎯 Quality Leadership
- **Risk-Based Strategy:** Uses structured approaches (e.g. RBT matrices) to prioritise testing effort  
- **Defect Triage & Analysis:** Assesses severity, performs RCA, and identifies systemic trends  
- **Collaboration & Influence:** Facilitates Three Amigos sessions and communicates clearly across roles  
- **Continuous Learning:** Actively stays current with tools, practices, and industry evolution  

---

### ✨ Gen AI Integration (Emerging Capability)
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafts effective prompts for test design, analysis, and exploration  
- **AI Tool Fluency:** Uses GenAI tools to accelerate—not replace—engineering thinking  
- **AI-Assisted Exploration:** Leverages AI suggestions to uncover new risks and scenarios  
- **Responsible AI Use:** Validates outputs, understands limitations, and avoids blind reliance

## 🗺️ Sample Team Competency Map

| Team Member | Exploratory Testing | Automation (Playwright) | API Testing | Test Strategy | Gen AI Proficiency | Team Collaboration |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Alice (Senior)** | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 |
| **Bob (Mid)** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| **Chloe (Junior)** | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 |
| **Dev (At Risk)** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |

> Visibility enables support. Surprises are a leadership failure.

## 💬 Development Conversations — Practical Examples

### 🛠️ Supporting Underperformance (Dev)

- **Challenge:** Low technical capability and misalignment with team ways of working  
- **Approach:**
  1. **Objective Framing:** Use the matrix to clearly illustrate current vs expected levels  
  2. **Targeted Mentorship:** Pair with Alice (Level 4) on a real feature  
  3. **Clear Outcome:** Achieve Level 2 in Exploratory Testing within one quarter  
  4. **Weekly Check-ins:** Short, supportive feedback loops  

> The intent is recovery and clarity—not blame.

---

### 📈 Strategic Upskilling (Bob)

- **Goal:** Progress from Level 2 → Level 3 in API Testing  
- **Action Plan:**
  - Own the API automation suite for a new feature  
  - Participate in structured peer reviews with Alice  
  - Document and share API testing best practices  

---

### 🌱 Leadership Pipeline (Alice)

- **Goal:** Transition from Senior Engineer to QA Technical Lead  
- **Action Plan:**
  - Lead an Exploratory Testing workshop  
  - Mentor two juniors in automation and strategy  
  - Co-author updates to the Risk-Based Testing framework  
  - Champion GenAI adoption through controlled pilots

✅ **Growth First Principle:**  
This framework exists to **develop capability**, surface opportunity, and build confidence—never to punish or label.
