🚀 30–60–90 Day Integration & Quality Delivery Plan

> Objective: To embed effectively into the Lead role by building trust, understanding the existing quality landscape, and delivering early, measurable improvements aligned to the Quality Manifesto￼.

---

## 🏁 Phase 1: Days 1–30 — Discovery & Alignment

*Goal: Understand the current state and build strong relationships with key stakeholders.*

* Stakeholder Engagement: Meet with Product Owners, Engineering Leads, and QA team members to understand delivery pressures and pain points (for example, slow pipelines or unclear acceptance criteria).
* Technical Assessment: Review the existing automation frameworks and CI/CD setup, focusing on stability, flakiness, execution time, and integration maturity.
* Process Review: Map the end-to-end delivery lifecycle from Requirement → Production and identify where quality issues or defects are most commonly introduced.
* Team Integration: Establish a regular cadence of 1-to-1s and introduce shared ways of working using the Team Working Agreement￼.

Outcome: A clear view of current risks, constraints, and improvement opportunities.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Days 31–60 — Stabilisation & Standards

*Goal: Introduce governance, reduce friction, and demonstrate value through quick, visible wins.*
* Gap Analysis: Compare current practices against the QA Maturity Matrix to identify priority improvement areas.
* Technical Alignment: Introduce agreed Automation Standards￼to standardise tooling, patterns, and quality expectations across teams.
* Quick Win Delivery: Target a high-impact issue (such as a flaky, business-critical test) and apply the principles from the Automation ROI Model to stabilise the pipeline.
* Capability Review: Review the Skills Matrix to identify training needs, upskilling opportunities, or longer-term resourcing gaps.

Outcome: Improved pipeline confidence and visible progress against agreed standards.

## 📈 Phase 3: Days 61–90 — Scale & Embed

*Goal: Establish continuous quality practices and enable long-term team ownership.*
* Shift-Left Adoption: Fully embed the Three Amigos Checklist￼into sprint refinement and planning to improve requirement clarity and reduce late-stage defects.
* Innovation Pilot: Launch an initial AI-assisted initiative, such as Automated Log Analysis, to reduce triage effort and accelerate feedback loops.
* Value Reporting: Present an initial Quality Value Report to leadership, highlighting measurable improvements in defect leakage, regression stability, and execution speed.
* Sustainable Ownership: Transition governance and quality standards to team ownership, allowing the Lead role to evolve from direct delivery into coaching and architectural guidance.

> Success Metric: By Day 90, the team has a clearly defined Quality Maturity Roadmap, a stable and trusted automation suite, and a consistent engineering culture where quality is a shared responsibility.
